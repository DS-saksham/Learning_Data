    "##### 3 Technically speaking, its derivative is Lipschitz continuous.4 Since feature 1 is smaller, it takes a larger change in θ1 to affect the cost function, which is why the bowl is elongated along the θ1 axis.Figure 4-6. Gradient Descent pitfallsFortunately, the MSE cost function for a Linear Regression model happens to be aconvex function, which means that if you pick any two points on the curve, the line segment joining them never crosses the curve. This implies that there are no local minima, just one global minimum. It is also a continuous function with a slope thatnever changes abruptly. These two facts have a great consequence: Gradient Descent is guaranteed to approach arbitrarily close the global minimum (if you wait long enough and if the learning rate is not too high)."
